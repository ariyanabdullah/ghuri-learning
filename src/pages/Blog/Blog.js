        <h3> What is The cors in Node Js ?</h3>
        <p>
          = CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing . It allows us to
          relax the security applied to an API. This is done by bypassing the
          Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers, which specify which origins can
          access the API.
